# A simple Project in Python.

This project contains three functions.

The first function "do_arithmetic" performs a given operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) between two given numbers (float or integer).

The second function "function_renamer" gets a multi-line Python code as input, finds every function name and replace it into its camel case back to the code.

The third function  "Pluralize_function" finds plural form if any of a given word. In addition the third function uses the txt file that contains proper nouns. Words that do not have plural form.
